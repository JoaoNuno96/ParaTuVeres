# ParaTuVeres

ParaTuVeres was a project developed in a course Web & Mobile Developer, in Cesae - Porto.
It was suggested that we developed an website of one of the following themes: kids band, news website, an e-commerce of a person that sells "bolinhos de bacalhau".
With this i choose news website, and to add a little humor i divided my website in 2 phases:
-News - users could get the latest info in some influencers;
-Gossip - useres could share storys and save them in a table, so other users could see;

Regarding structure, this website, was developed using react (installed with ViteJs), used bootstrap for the content, and for editing pictures (in this case i made the background image) i used Adobe Photoshop.
